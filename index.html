		<h3>Normal Hours Notice:</h3>
		<p>Due to the affect of the winter weather on our product and lowered foot traffic at the market, we
			will be operating in an online only capacity for the time being. This is to ensure that you
			receive the highest quality baked goods possible that meet our standards. Thank you so much for
			your patience and continued support!</p>
