			<h3>❄️ Weather Winter Notice ❄️</h3>
			<p>Due to the affect of the winter weather on our products and lowered foot traffic at the
				market, we
				will not be attending for the time being. This is to ensure that you
				receive the highest quality baked goods possible that meet our standards as soon as it
				warms back up!
			</p>

			<p>Thank you so
				much for your patience and continued support! If you have any questions, don't hesitate
				to reach us at <a href="mailto:contact@littleloaf.co">contact@litteloaf.co</a>!</p>

						<span>We don't do social media around here. This is the best way to keep up with what we're doing. We send out weekly menus for what we'll have at the market as well as early notices for anything cool coming up! As always, we hate spam as much as you do so you'll never get it from us!</span>
